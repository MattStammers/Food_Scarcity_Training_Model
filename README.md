# Food_Scarcity_Training_Model
Simple SD Training Model with a non-medical base topic

This model was initially compiled using the BPTK framework but is now being recompiled using PySD

It is extremely simple as you will se below and it's purpose is purely to act as a basic training model. due to poor signal today on the train the model probably won't be uploaded till tomorrow. I'm not even sure if this commit will push...
